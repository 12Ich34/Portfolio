                <p>In last summer vacation, we have been assigned to do a project called "STEM Project". It was an individual project, we can choose any topic to be <br>our project, however, that topic need to be related to STEM; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. I chose "Graph Art" to be my topic. This topic relate to Mathematics,<br>it is about the image that is made by graphing. Graphing each equation make a line, every lines will be graphed to satisfy the place in order to create an image that we are trying to do.

                <p>On the last semester, I have created an engineering project with my groups. We analyzed on our school's problems as a group, narrow down problems and then<br> focus on just one topic. We have to brainstorming on these topics a lot. We have decided to make a "Message board" on a problem: Students didn't get much inforamation <br>and tend to forget it. Teachers can write homework, or annoucement on a board to notify students.
